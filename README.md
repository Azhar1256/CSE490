Building Segmentation

Building segmentation is a process of dividing an image into multiple segments or regions that correspond to different buildings in the image. It is a critical task in remote sensing studies for automatic detection of buildings in urban
areas. One of the popular techniques used for building segmentation is U-Net which is a convolutional neural network architecture that was developed for biomedical image segmentation. It has been used in various applications such
as medical image segmentation, road segmentation, and building segmentation. Image processing techniques are also used in building segmentation to enhance the quality of images and improve the accuracy of segmentation. This mapping
based segmentation process can be helpful in more tasks other than making maps. After segmentation we proceed to find the congestion level using black and white ratio. Which may be helpful for correlation tasks.
